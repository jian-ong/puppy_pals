<b>The Project: </b> <br>
This project was made for done 6 weeks into the Software Engineering Immersive course.
The brief was to create a full stack CRUD app of our own choosing using knowledge learnt in class and the help of the internet. My take on the CRUD app was in a form of a dog-dating website.The purpose for this website was to connect dogs in their local neighbourhoods, making organising doggy playdates easy and share information about all things dog-related.

<b>Functionalities: </b> <br> 
- Create user account with password authorization
- Create profile
- Edit profile 
- Delete the account
- Search for other dogs using different categories(name, age, gender, breed, keywords and location)
- Private messaging

<b>Technologies used: </b><br>
Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL, Postgres, Sinatra, BCrypt

<b>Next Steps and Improvements:</b> <br>
- Add an error message when password is wrong
- Code cleanup
- Creating a "Like" button and a Ranking system for popularity based on number of "Likes"
- CSS needs some fixing - font colour change on hover not working

<b>The Brief:</b> <br>
# **Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application**

### **Overview**

This second project is your first foray into **building a database backed web application.** You'll be **building a Sinatra app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we'll give you the tools to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. We want to highlight the server side for this project but you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

### **Technical Requirements**

Your app must:

- **Have *ideally* 2 resources(tables)** (more tables if they make sense or less tables) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- **Include sign up/log in functionality(if they make sense)**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
- **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resource with GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE for read, create, update and delete
- **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
- Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
- **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

---

### **Necessary Deliverables**

- A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
- A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- **A `readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme (photos of your sketches on paper or whiteboard are fined)
- A link in your `readme.md` to the publically-accessible planning diagrams
